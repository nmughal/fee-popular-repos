# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.

# About
This project utilizes an angular directive to retrieve a list of repositories for a given user, which can be used on other pages of the site in the future. It also uses angular filters to list repositories by popularity order with the project's size converted to megabytes.
