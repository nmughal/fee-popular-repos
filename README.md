# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.

# About
This project utilizes an angular directive to retrieve a list of repositories for a given user, which can be used on other pages of the site in the future.
